The Final Project Zip contains the analysis code and the extracted data of importance. To access the data, first extract the Final_Project.zip file, and then load the code into Jupyter. Change the file paths in the .ipynb files into the paths of the folder, or the file within the folder. 
Th file/folder names inside the .ipynb file is the same as the file/folder names in the zip, and only the path elements need to be shifted. None of the data is my own, and all of the data was collected by Morgenthroth et al. (2025).
